# And (condition)

Matches when both conditions match, yielding the second condition's result. If the
first condition doesn't match, then the second condition isn't executed.

Both conditions receive the same input value.

Note: the conditions can result in falsy values and still be considered a match,
unlike the `&&` operator in JS.

```js
import match from 'pattahn';
import And from 'pattahn/cond/And';
import Always from 'pattahn/cond/Always';
```

```js
const VALUE = 1;

const result = match()
  .with(And(Always(1), Always(2)), (x) => x)
  .exec(VALUE);

expect(result).toBe(2);
```
