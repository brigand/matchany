# Condition

The `Condition` class represents a boolean match and/or a transformation of the input
values.

```js
import { Condition } from 'pattahn/core';
```

You can subclass `Condition` by defining a constructor (which passes the name to
super) and an `exec` method which takes at least one argument and returns `null` or an
array of results. Here's the simplest Condition: the identity condition.

```js
class Id extends Condition {
  constructor() {
    super('Id');
  }

  exec(...args) {
    return args;
  }
}

module.exports = Id.factory;

const result = Id.factory().exec(7);
expect(result).toEqual([7]);

// The class is also exposed as a property of the factory
expect(Id.factory.class).toBe(Id);
```

There's a `.factory` getter on `Condition` that simply allows the class to be
constructed without `new`. All first-party conditions export the factory to clean up
the consuming code.
