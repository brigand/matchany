# match (chain variant)

When match is called with 0 or 1 argument it returns a chainable instance for defining
patterns to match on.

The main two methods are `.with` to add a branch to the matching, and `.exec` to run
the match operation (which can be called multiple times, if desired).

```js
import match from 'pattahn';

const r1 = match()
  .with('foo', 'is foo')
  .with('bar', 'is bar')
  .exec('foo');

// The value can alternatively be provided to match() as a single argument,
// if preferred for style.
const r2 = match('foo')
  .with('foo', 'is foo')
  .with('bar', 'is bar')
  .exec();

expect(r1).toBe('is foo');
expect(r2).toBe('is foo');
```

The first argument to `.with` is a condition, or a value supported by
[intoCondition](/into-condition).

The second argument is either a literal value, or a function that takes the output of
the condition and returns the value. If the resulting value will be a function, then
you need a function that returns a function.

## Other methods

The `.any` takes the second argument to `.with` and matches on any input (i.e. the
default case for a match). The call `.any(result)` is identical to
`.with(Test(() => true), result)`.

Both `.any` and `.with` return the matcher object to allow chaining.

The `.clone` method takes no arguments and returns a shallow clone of the matcher
(where `.clone().with(...)` won't add a condition to the original).
